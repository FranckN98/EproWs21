# How to use the Hoppscotch collection
To use the Hoppscotch collection, you first must open 
[hoppscotch.io](hoppscotch.io), what you see here is already the
hoppscotch client.

As this project is not deployed anywhere currently, you also must install
the Hoppscotch Extension for [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/hoppscotch/) or [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hoppscotch-browser-extens/amknoiejhlmhancpahfcfcfhllgkpbld).

With the extension installed the next step is to import the collection into
Hoppscotch. You can do this by navigating to the Collections Tab in the sidebar, which is
to the right of the query-composer. By clicking the top right Button (next to the circled
question mark) you will be taken to a context menu, where you choose the "Import from 
Hoppscotch" option to import the `hoppscotchCollection.json` file.

When the Collection is imported you will see a folder called `Epro` with
several subfolders, which contain the prepared requests for all entities.
If you have the Application as well as the DB-Docker Container running, you
can now use Hoppscotch to send requests to the Application.
